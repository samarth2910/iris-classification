This is a beginner-friendly machine learning project using the classic Iris flower dataset. The goal is to classify flowers into three species — Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica — based on features like petal and sepal length and width.

# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification

This project demonstrates classification of iris flower species using various machine learning models. The dataset is a classic from the UCI repository and contains features such as petal and sepal length/width for three iris species.
